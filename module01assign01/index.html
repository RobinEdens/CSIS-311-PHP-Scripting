<!-- In addition to the changes described in the other comments, add an external CSS file that you write yourself and reference it from within here. It should have the goal of making this look prettier - maybe making it look like a business card that a professional might hand out at a networking event. -->

So far through this class, you learned about how to put a file on puff.mnstate.edu and the various directories that are set up for you within there.

You are to put this there on puff.mnstate.edu at the following path:

/home/StarID/public_html/private/module01assign01

Where "StarID" should be replaced with your Star ID.

Then, as indicated in class, you should be able to access it, using a web browser on campus, using the following URL:

http://puff.mnstate.edu/~StarID/private/module01assign01

In order to do so, you'll need to log in using your MySQL username and password, which you can utilize the resources there in the appropriate section of D2L Brightspace to help you figure out/adjust/reset as needed.
